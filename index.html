<h2>Strategic Communication</h2>
<p>Design isn't just about aesthetics, it's about effective communication. I combine visual storytelling with strategic content management to create websites that inform, engage, and inspire action.</p>

<h2>Accessibility First</h2>
<p>Digital inclusion is at the heart of my work. I design with WCAG guidelines in mind, ensuring websites are accessible to users of all abilities.</p>

<h3>What I Offer</h3>
<p>Whether you're looking to refresh an existing website or build from scratch I bring a comprehensive approach that combines technical expertise with creative vision.</p>
